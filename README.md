# Product Listing with Google Tag Manager (GTM) & React Bootstrap

## 🚀 Project Overview

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app), that displays a list of products using React Bootstrap for styling and layout. It also integrates Google Tag Manager (GTM) to track clicks on products that have a badge (e.g., "Sale" or "New").

## 🏗️ How It Works

1️⃣ Product List (index.js) loads dynamic product data with badges.
2️⃣ Product Card (ProductCard.js) displays each product with Bootstrap styling.
3️⃣ Click Tracking: If a product has a badge, a GTM event fires with the product details.
4️⃣ Logs event to the console for debugging.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Next.js (React Framework)
- React Bootstrap (UI Components)
- Google Tag Manager (GTM) (Event Tracking)
- CSS (global styles)
